# AES-ChaCha20 Encryption 

This repository contains a Python implementation of double encryption using the AES and ChaCha20 algorithms. Double encryption enhances security by applying two layers of encryption, making it more resilient against attacks.

## Features
- **Double Encryption**: Encrypts messages using both AES and ChaCha20 algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.
- **Algorithm Explanations**: Detailed explanations of encryption techniques and algorithms used.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:
- **cryptography**: A library for secure communications and cryptography.
- **base64**: Required for data encoding/decoding.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/BlueGoat11/aes-chacha20-encryption.git
2. Install the dependencies listed above.

## Usage
Simply run the provided script, and the usage will become self-explanatory.

## Algorithm Explanations
Explore detailed explanations of the AES and ChaCha20 algorithms, initialization vectors (IVs), padding, and other encryption-related terms. You can refer to the source code or run the file for more insights.

## HTML CSS and JS Conversion
